# Masters-Thesis-Security-and-Robustness-of-NN

In the modern era, machine learning algorithms are using in several areas toprocess big data and information. However, the deep learning algorithm comeswith security vulnerabilities in itself. Further, it is still an emerging researcharea to find a proper countermeasure against the exploitation of neural networks.Though Tesla has made progress enormously in a self-driving car, afterward, aresearch team of Tencent Keen Security Lab has detected security vulnerabilitiesin the Tesla system design of self-driving cars. In this project, it is built a robustneural network algorithm to defend an adversary for real-time self-driving cars toidentify accurately road traffic signs and then executed white-box and black-boxattack methods on the same algorithm using FGSM for untargeted and I-FGSM fortargeted misclassification in output label. Then it is analyzed and evaluated withseveral testing how the model behaves against the attack and put an argument toestablish a well-defined security assessment standard on machine learning modelfor decision systems in the testing phase of ML for evasion attack.
